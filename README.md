# Grabbing and Throwing objects using Oculus Touch and CV1

A quick demo showing grabbing objects with the Oculus Touch. 
Latest build uses Unity 5.6.1f1 Personal Edition (64bit).

This demo moves objects through changing of x,y,z positions.

Note: For a full fledged game, I would recommend [NewtonVR](https://github.com/TomorrowTodayLabs/NewtonVR).
